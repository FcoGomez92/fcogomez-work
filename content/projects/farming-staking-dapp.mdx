## Summary

I developed this project as a freelance assignment for a startup. After the token launch event, I proposed to the CEO a solution for stabilizing their LP token liquidity while empowering holders to optimize their ROI.
The result? A tailored DeFi platform that allows their users to stake their tokens and earn returns in either the same token or another. With options for both fixed and variable interest rates, users can seamlessly engage in staking activities while maximizing their potential earnings. 

## How it works?

- I help the client define the staking conditions.
- We configure variables such as the staking token, reward token, reward amount, staking period, fees, penalties, minimum time to withdraw, starting date, etc.
- Deploy the Smart Contract and integrate it into their project or create a new custom DeFi app.
- Now, their token holders can stake on the platform, monitor contributions, rewards, APRs, and withdraw their chosen amount.

## Technology Used

- React
- CSS-in-jsx
- Solidity
- Hardhat
- Chai

## Responsibilities as developer

- Listen to the client, understand their needs, and choose the best options for the project.
- Educate and guide clients on Blockchain Technology and its implications.
- Study the client's tokenomics and token liquidity to determine the best approach for their staking system.
- Design both staking systems: one with a fixed APR (Annual Percentage Rate) and one with a dynamic APR.
- Develop, test, and deploy the staking Smart Contracts following the best practices to ensure good quality and secure code.
- Design and create mock-ups for the DeFi app based on the client’s branding.
- Architect the DeFi app and file system to ensure code is understandable, maintainable, and scalable.
- Develop the DeFi app, enabling the users to connect to the blockchain and interact with the client’s smart contract.
- Analyze the performance of the DeFi apps, making changes and optimizing the code if necessary.

## Key accomplishment:

- Enable full customization of Smart Contracts, providing clients with complete flexibility to design a tailor-made staking system according to their preferences.
- Ensure stability for the client's token, enhancing the value of their entire ecosystem, while enabling token holders to achieve a higher Return on Investment (ROI).
