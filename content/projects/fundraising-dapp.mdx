## Summary

I developed this project for the first time in 2022. It originated as a freelance assignment for a startup. The CEO aimed to raise capital in a seed phase with professional private investors using blockchain, generating a company token for this purpose.

Upon completing this project, I recognized opportunities for enhancements that enabled me to adapt the code for new clients, accommodating different project stages, investment conditions, and company tokenomics.

## How it works?

- Define the investment conditions and tokenomics: Tiers, cliff, vesting, token quantity to emit, name, logo.
- Specify the cryptocurrency to be received (e.g., ETH, BNB, Stable Coins like USDT, USDC), and price.
- Initiate the Token Generation Event.
- The investors contribute to the project from your custom web3 app.
- After the cliff time, investors can claim the tokens associated following the vesting conditions.
- Optionally, each month investors can receive an airdrop with rewards based on the token quantity held.

## Technology Used

- Next.js
- CSS-in-jsx
- Solidity
- Truffle Suite
- Alchemy

## Responsibilities as developer

- Listen to the client, understand their needs, and choose the best options for the project.
- Educate and guide clients on Blockchain Technology and its implications.
- Design the raising capital system Smart Contract, the custom ERC-20, and define the company tokenomics.
- Develop, test, and deploy Smart Contracts following the best practices to ensure good quality and secure code.
- Design and create mock-ups for the web3 app based on the client’s branding.
- Architect the web3 app and file system to ensure code is understandable, maintainable, and scalable.
- Develop the web3 app, enabling the users to connect to the blockchain and interact with the client’s smart contract.
- Analyze the performance of the web3 apps, making changes and optimizing the code if necessary.
- Develop the airdrop script to reward to the client’s token holders monthly based on the quantity held.

## Key accomplishment:

- More than $200.000 was raised by the clients between pre-seed round and public token sales.
- Deliver a good quality code whithin a tight deadline.
