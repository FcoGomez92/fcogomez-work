With the explosion of diverse blockchains and the continuous emergence of new bridges, navigating the blockchain ecosystem can feel like a maze. I want to simplify this complexity by providing a centralized hub for discovering and comparing bridges.
As the number of bridges for a given route grows, it becomes challenging to discern which one is the most efficient and cost-effective. FindMyBridge streamlines this process, ensuring users can easily identify the best bridge for their specific needs, saving time, money, and resources in the ever-expanding blockchain landscape.

## How it works?

###### Swap section

1. The user connects the wallet.
2. Select the origin blockchain and token to swap.
3. Select the destination blockchain and token to receive.
4. The app displays the swap path, the protocols involved, and relevant data such as execution time, transaction fees, and more.
5. The user accepts and clicks on swap.
6. The app shows the process until the transaction has been completed.
7. The user can access their history and check the transactions status.

###### Finder section

1. The user selects the origin blockchain from all the available chains, including testnets.
2. The app displays all the available destinations for sending the tokens.
3. The user then selects the destination blockchain.
4. The app presents all the available bridges for swapping assets between the two selected blockchains.
5. Users can compare the bridges and make informed decisions based on execution times, transaction fees, and stay updated with the latest relevant information for each bridge.

###### Tools section

1. A curated directory of other useful tools and resources for cross-chain users.

###### Admin dashboard

1. The admins have to authenticate themselves by signing in with an authorized wallet.
2. The admins can view the current list of all available chains, bridges, and routes between them.
3. The admins can check, modify, or delete information about chains, bridges, and routes.
4. The admins can review all the collected data regarding users' transactions, popularity of chains and bridges, telegram bot usage, and generate graphical reports for a more thorough analysis.
